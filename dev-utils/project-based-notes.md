## Session file

stores:

- `core.recent_projects`
- `core.recents_open`
- window's size and mode

### Rational

It just stores the window's mode and the list of recents projects and recently
opened file.

Maybe we should not have recent projects, all existing projects should be
listed. Also the window's size and mode should be part of a project.
